# Pets workshop

This repository contains two workshops:

- a [one hour](./1-hour/README.md) workshop focused on GitHub Copilot.
- a [full-day](./full-day/README.md) workshop which covers a full day-in-the-life of a developer using GitHub for their DevOps processes.
- a [75â€‘minute Agent Mode](./75-min-agent/README.md) workshop with Copilot Agent as the hero, MCP issues, and PR assist.

Both workshops are built around a fictional dog shelter, where you are a volunteer helping them build out their website.
