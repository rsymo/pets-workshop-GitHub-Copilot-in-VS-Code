# 3 — Agent implements backend (12–15 min)

Goal: Add a minimal Favorites API using Agent mode. Tests first, then code.

Steps:
1) Ask the Agent:
   - “Add GET /api/favorites and POST /api/favorites to toggle a dog’s favorite flag. Write pytest tests mocking DB calls (follow server/test_app.py style). Add TODOs where needed.”
2) Review the diff in the Edits panel. Keep/Undo as needed.
3) Run tests (Task: Run Tests). Ask the Agent to fix failures.

Tip: Favor minimal diffs and mock DB queries like existing tests.
