# 4 — Agent fixes tests (8–10 min)

Goal: Iterate to green with Agent. Use @tests and @terminal contexts.

Prompts:
- “@tests Read failures, propose smallest fix, apply as a single diff.”
- “@terminal Re-run pytest for server/test_app.py only and summarize results.”

Deliverable: All tests passing.
