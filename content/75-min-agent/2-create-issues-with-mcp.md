# 2 — Create issues with MCP (5 min)

Use Copilot’s MCP GitHub connector to create issues from your plan.

Suggested issues:
- Backend: Add Favorites endpoints + tests (mock DB).
- Frontend: Add FavoriteButton and wire to API.
- Debug: Seeded failure scenario.

Prompts:
- “Using MCP, create GitHub issues for the plan above. Include acceptance criteria and labels workshop/75m.”
- “Link the issues to each other with dependencies.”

If MCP isn’t available, use Chat to draft issue bodies and paste into GitHub manually.
