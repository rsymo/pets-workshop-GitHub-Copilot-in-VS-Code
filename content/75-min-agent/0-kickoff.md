# 0 — Kickoff (5 min)

Goals:
- Verify environment (Codespaces or local) and Copilot sign-in.
- Start backend and frontend tasks.
- Warm up Copilot Chat.

Checklist:
1. Open this repo in VS Code or Codespaces. Ensure Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions are enabled.
2. Install the GitHub MCP server by following instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp.
3. Start servers (Tasks → Start Backend, Start Frontend). If tasks are missing, or you want a one-step setup, run the quickstart script:
   This will set up a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and start both backend and frontend automatically.
4. In Chat: “@workspace Summarize the backend Flask app and the Svelte components we will touch.”
5. Show Copilot Edits quickly: add a short docstring to app.py, preview, Keep/Undo.
