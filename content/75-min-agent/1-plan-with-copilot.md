# 1 — Plan with Copilot (5–8 min)

Use Copilot to brainstorm, scope, and define acceptance criteria for a small feature: Favorites.

Prompts to paste:
- “Help me plan a Favorites feature for this app. Propose minimal API and UI changes, and acceptance criteria.”
- “List edge cases and a tiny test plan. Keep it to 5 bullets.”

Deliverable:
- A short plan in your notes or `content/notes.md`.
